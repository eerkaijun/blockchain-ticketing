# Aries Cloud Agent - Python (ACA-py) Demo Controllers

To start the demo, run the following commands from this directory: 

```
$ LEDGER_URL=http://dev.greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo webstart

```

It may take a while for the all the agents and controllers to start up. You will also notice a number of ports appear once the demo is up. You will want to click the `9021`, `9031`, and `9041` ports to open up the Faber, Alice and Acme controllers in separate browser tabs, respectively. These are the equivalent to the `http://localhost:<port>` URLs referenced later in the demo.
